## Using AD to integrated app to App service. 

### New Registration App 

In this approach we will be setting up Appservice which creates App registration Id automatically - which can be helpful. 

1. create your app service 
2. next, from your appservice -> authentication -> Add identify provider and choose Microsoft Active Directory
3. by default new App registration will be selected. Give it a name or use the default. 
4. click next and you can "Add Permission or Scope" to it. 


### Using exising App Registration -> more steps :)
